# ElevenLabs Performance Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to testing and measuring your ElevenLabs integration performance using the enhanced measurement framework. The system now tracks comprehensive metrics for latency, connection stability, audio quality, and PRD compliance.

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Basic Performance Test (5 minutes)
1. **Start the app** and click "Start Conversation"
2. **Ask 5 simple questions** like:
   - "Hello, how are you?"
   - "What's your name?"
   - "What time is it?"
   - "How's the weather?"
   - "Tell me a joke"
3. **Rate audio quality** after each response (1-10 scale)
4. **Note any issues** like cutouts, static, or delays
5. **End conversation** and review the performance summary

### 2. Connection Stability Test (15 minutes)
1. **Start conversation** and maintain for 15+ minutes
2. **Monitor connection status** - watch for any disconnections
3. **Ask questions periodically** to test response consistency
4. **Check uptime percentage** in the performance metrics
5. **Note reconnection times** if disconnections occur

### 3. Network Impact Test (10 minutes)
1. **Test on different network conditions**:
   - Excellent: WiFi or 5G
   - Good: 4G
   - Poor: 3G or throttled connection
   - Very Poor: 2G or heavily throttled
2. **Compare response times** across conditions
3. **Note audio quality differences**
4. **Record any failures** or significant degradation

## Testing Checklist

### Before Each Test Session
- [ ] Clear browser cache/restart app
- [ ] Check network connection quality
- [ ] Ensure consistent device settings
- [ ] Prepare test questions list
- [ ] Set network condition in app

### During Testing
- [ ] Record start time
- [ ] Ask questions consistently
- [ ] Rate audio quality after each response
- [ ] Note any technical issues
- [ ] Monitor connection status
- [ ] Track response times

### After Testing
- [ ] End conversation properly
- [ ] Review performance summary
- [ ] Export data for analysis
- [ ] Document any issues

- **Network**: Same network type and location when possible
- **Question Types**: Use standardized question sets for comparison

### Systematic Data Recording
- **Response Times**: Note each response time immediately
- **Audio Quality**: Rate immediately after hearing response
- **Issues**: Document specific problems with timestamps
- **Context**: Record network conditions and device state

### Data Export and Analysis
- **Export After Each Session**: Use the export button to save data
- **Weekly Review**: Analyze trends and patterns
- **Monthly Summary**: Create comprehensive performance report
- **Client Presentation**: Prepare clear, non-technical summaries
